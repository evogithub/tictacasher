Tic Tac Toe - Server Side 2 players

Random Choice who goes first X or O
Keep count of how many games played total on the server. "Played XXX times" Display bottom right of screen (float bottom)
Display attribution: "A game by Asher Shlachtman and David Chehebar" (bottom left of screen)

Need to fix if player clicks on a square that is already taken, it counts as a turn, and it should not
Come up with a sound if player clicks on an existing occupied square (low tone beep)
There is something wrong with the click inputs!!!
A Draw game can occur BEFORE the last move is made (due to ability to click on occupied square)

Fix sound triggers / Random is overlapping with "your move player..."

Can Trigger welcome sound by using user request of Location (select_location.html) as a user requested trigger (to overcome autoplay problem).
Allow welcome sound to play completely before allowing players to play.
Develop "let the fight begin" graphic - do not allow players to play until graphic disapears
Use some sort of Zoom in/out CSS animation with graphic


There should be a turn countdown timer - max 10 seconds (Display above game)
Change "Current Player: X" (above background gif) to "Your Move Player X. Time remaining to move (countdown timer)"

Fix Location Select HTML to load proper background GIF
(add - Player_X_select_stage) sound loader

Need to pre-load background music because it won't autoplay
   DOES autoplay when the sound has already been loaded
Need to fix background music to LOOP / instead of lame 3 repeats
Need to add background music for locations 2-6
Background music should stop when game over
Need to display game over graphic
Need to prompt to play again (load play again sound)

Winning game pieces should pulse glow to show winning move
Game Winning animation that goes across wining squares - like lightening with sound (need 8 similar animations)
Need a graphic which displays who won and game over
Increase Random Sounds from 10% to 20% from =="1" to <3
Improve Random sounds! (ex: Fantastic!, Spectacular! Amazing! Unbelievable!)

tighten up stage 1 background music

Random Player win gloating sounds - 10% time.
"X marks the spot!"
"I knew I would win"
"Oh No! I knew O would win!"

Test in different browsers: IE/FF/OP
Test in mobile



Near Future:
Need player registration / email / name
Need player invite friends
Need player request match with friend
Need a Lobby
Need Automatch Player to opponent if playing in "lobby"
CPU player if no one in the lobby?

Turn Modal / player cannot go when it's not his turn
Timer / Player should only have max 10 seconds to play or they lose their turn

Coinflip animation for who goes first?
Better/more random sounds / better/more hit sounds (tighten up sounds)

Player win/loss total

mobile detection

FUTURE:
Player selects charachter?
Asher
Dave
Dara
CPU?!/Robot?
Celebrity???
Celebrity???
???
???
???

player can select from 9 charchters? (friends greenscreened?)
with different X/O objects and sounds and animations per charachter
Video Green Screen of Charachters (me and asher?!) - off to sides - making animated moves when turn is executed
Some Transparent Video / aftereffects? for special effects? or perhaps momentary animation working with Charachters
Right/Left Orientations for charachters
Rigs for animations of Non-video charachters

Need a Battle Screen Player vs Player
